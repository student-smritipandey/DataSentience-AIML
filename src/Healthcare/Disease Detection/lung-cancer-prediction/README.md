# 🫁 Lung Cancer Risk Predictor

A machine learning-based project that predicts whether an individual is at risk of lung cancer based on lifestyle and medical survey responses. This tool can be useful for early awareness and screening guidance.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on a lung cancer survey dataset. Given basic information like age, gender, smoking status, and common symptoms, the model predicts whether the person is likely to be at risk of lung cancer.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Step 1: Install Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
````

---

### 2️⃣ Step 2: Preprocess the Data

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

✅ This script:

* Converts categorical text into numeric values
* Renames columns to standard format
* Drops missing rows
* Saves clean data to `cleaned_data.csv`

---

### 3️⃣ Step 3: Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

✅ This script:

* Trains a `RandomForestClassifier`
* Prints a classification report
* Saves the model to `models/rf_model.pkl`

---

### 4️⃣ Step 4: Predict Lung Cancer Risk

```bash
python predict.py
```

✅ This script:

* Uses a sample input dictionary
* Predicts if the person is at risk
* Outputs: `YES (At Risk)` or `NO (Not at Risk)`

---

## 🧪 Sample Input for Prediction

```python
sample_input = {
    'GENDER': 'M',
    'AGE': 65,
    'SMOKING': 1,
    'YELLOW_FINGERS': 1,
    'ANXIETY': 1,
    'PEER_PRESSURE': 1,
    'CHRONIC_DISEASE': 1,
    'FATIGUE': 1,
    'ALLERGY': 0,
    'WHEEZING': 1,
    'ALCOHOL_CONSUMING': 1,
    'COUGHING': 1,
    'SHORTNESS_OF_BREATH': 1,
    'SWALLOWING_DIFFICULTY': 1,
    'CHEST_PAIN': 1
}
```
