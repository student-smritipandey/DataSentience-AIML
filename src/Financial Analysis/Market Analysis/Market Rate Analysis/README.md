# 💱 Currency Rate Forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM

This project predicts currency exchange rates (e.g., INR to USD) using two powerful time series models:
- **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)** — for linear trends
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** — a type of RNN, ideal for capturing sequential patterns

It uses a cleaned version of historical exchange rate data across countries, and outputs short-term forecasts.
